| **13 – Capstone Close**                    | Runbook + rollback + final checklist   | You asked for student-ready packaging. We started structuring this as a **runbook + rollback plan + checklist + smoke scripts**                 | `docs/*`, `scripts/*` (capstone pack concept)                                             | “Happy path” and K8s smoke flows                                  | This is where we’ll standardize **one version for both images** (you want **0.1.4**) and freeze the teaching path                                                                                                            | 🔜 In progress / next step              |
